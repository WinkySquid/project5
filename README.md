# project5 : Arithmetic Test (Baldi Edition)
This is one of my earlier projects, so don't take it too seriously.
You get a chance to test your basic math skills by performing some addition and subtraction problems with Baldi as your teacher!
(yes this is loosely based off Baldi's Basics in Education and Learning, don't sue me...)
